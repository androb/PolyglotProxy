Write a TinyMCE plugin for interacting with the OpenAI ChatGPT APIs. 

It should
- add a toolbar button that opens a sidebar
- the sidebar should look like a chatbot UI

The Chatbot UI should have everything that a typical ChatGPT-style chatbot should have. 

It should
- ask for user input with a send button
- send the question to the ChatGPT API
- show the ChatGPT response in the UI
- next to each ChatGPT response there should be a button to insert it into the editor at the current cursor location
- enable the user to post a follow-up question
- there should be a button to clear the conversation
